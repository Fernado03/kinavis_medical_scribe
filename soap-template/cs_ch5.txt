What does the enrollment process in a biometric system involve?|An enrollment scan, processing for key features, and storing a template of these features.|Biometrics, Enrollment, System Setup|5-29
Why is scan data variable in biometric systems?|For example, a fingerprint might be scanned differently each time. However, the key features extracted should be nearly the same.|Biometrics, Variability, Feature Extraction|5-29
How does a biometric system work during an access attempt?|It captures access data (e.g., a new fingerprint scan), converts it into key feature data, and compares it with the stored template.|Biometrics, Authentication Process, Comparison|5-29
Will biometric access key features ever be exactly the same as the template?|No, they will never be exactly the same.|Biometrics, Template Matching, Variability|5-29
What is needed in a biometric system to decide if a new scan matches a template?|Configurable decision criteria (a match index) to determine how close the match needs to be.|Biometrics, Match Index, System Configuration|5-30
What happens if the match index in a biometric system is too exact?|It will cause many false rejections (legitimate users denied access).|Biometrics, False Rejections, Accuracy|5-30
What happens if the match index in a biometric system is too loose?|It will cause more false acceptances (impostors granted access).|Biometrics, False Acceptances, Security Risk|5-30
Describe the biometric authentication system process shown in Figure 5-10.|1. Initial enrollment: User Lee's fingerprint is scanned, key features are extracted (A=01, B=101, C=001), and a template (01101001) is stored in a database.<br>2. Subsequent access: A supplicant (claiming to be Lee) scans their fingerprint, features are extracted (A=01, B=111, C=001), creating user access data (01111001).<br>3. Matching: The system compares the new access data to Lee's stored template using a match index decision criterion (is it "close enough"?).|Biometrics, Authentication Process, Enrollment, Matching|Fig 5-10, 5-31
What is the difference between an error rate and a deception rate in biometrics?|- Error rate: Refers to accuracy when the supplicant is NOT trying to deceive the system.<br>- Deception rate: The likelihood that an impostor WILL be able to deceive the system if they try.|Biometrics, Error Rate, Deception Rate, Accuracy|5-32, 5-35
What are False Acceptance Rates (FARs) in biometrics?|The percentage of people who are incorrectly identified or verified as matching a template when they should not be (e.g., an impostor is accepted).|Biometrics, FAR, False Acceptance|5-33
What are False Rejection Rates (FRRs) in biometrics?|The percentage of people who should be identified or verified as matching a template but are not (e.g., a legitimate user is rejected).|Biometrics, FRR, False Rejection|5-33
What is a common issue with vendor claims for FARs and FRRs?|They tend to be exaggerated because they are often based on tests under ideal conditions.|Biometrics, Vendor Claims, Accuracy|5-34
What is Failure to Enroll (FTE) in biometric systems?|When a subject cannot enroll in the system (e.g., due to poor fingerprints from construction work, age, etc.).|Biometrics, FTE, Enrollment Issues|5-34
What is "Verification" in biometric authentication?|The supplicant claims to be a particular person, and the system compares their access data to that single person's template to verify the claim (1:1 match). It's good for replacing passwords in logins.|Biometrics, Verification, 1-to-1 Match|5-36
If the probability of a false acceptance is 1/1000 (0.1%) per template match in verification, what is the overall probability of false acceptance?|It remains 1/1000 (0.1%) because it's a single comparison.|Biometrics, Verification, FAR|5-36
What is "Identification" in biometric authentication?|The supplicant does not state their identity. The system must compare their access data to all templates in the database to find the correct one (1:N match). Good for door access.|Biometrics, Identification, 1-to-N Match|5-37
If the probability of a false acceptance is 1/1000 per template match, and there are 500 templates in the database for identification, what is the overall probability of false acceptance?|The probability of a false acceptance becomes 500 * (1/1000) = 50%.|Biometrics, Identification, FAR, Scalability|5-37
What are "Watch Lists" in biometric authentication?|A subset of identification where the goal is to identify members of a specific group. It involves more comparisons than verification but fewer than full identification.|Biometrics, Watch Lists, Identification|5-38
If the probability of a false acceptance is 1/1000 per template match, and there are 10 templates in a watch list, what is the overall probability of false acceptance?|The probability of a false acceptance is 10 * (1/1000) = 1%.|Biometrics, Watch Lists, FAR|5-38
In biometric systems, which is worse: a false acceptance or a false rejection?|It depends on the situation.<br>- For computer access (identification or verification), a false acceptance is a security violation (worse), while a false rejection is an inconvenience.<br>- For a watch list for door access, a false acceptance is a security violation (worse), while a false rejection is an inconvenience.<br>- For a watch list for terrorists, a false rejection (missing a terrorist) is a security violation (worse), while a false acceptance (misidentifying an innocent person) is an inconvenience (though potentially serious).|Biometrics, FAR, FRR, Risk Assessment|5-39

What is often the weakest link in PKI provisioning?|Human registration, because if an impostor is given credentials, no technology access controls will work.|PKI, Provisioning, Human Factor, Security Risks|5-46
What are some important aspects of secure provisioning in PKI?|- Limit who can submit names for registration.<br>- Limit who can authorize registration.<br>- Have rules for exceptions.<br>- Must have effective terminating procedures (when access is no longer needed).<br>- Supervisors and Human Resources department must assist.|PKI, Provisioning, Best Practices, Security Procedures|5-46
Briefly describe the PKI process shown in Figure 5-18 for Lee (Supplicant) getting a certificate and Cheng (Verifier) checking it.|1. Lee generates a private key and sends the public key to the Certificate Authority (CA/PKI Server).<br>2. The CA issues a digital certificate for Lee's public key and sends it back to Lee.<br>3. Later, Lee (Supplicant) wants to communicate with Cheng (Verifier). Lee presents their certificate to Cheng.<br>4. (5a) Cheng receives Lee's certificate.<br>5. (5b) Cheng may check with the CA if Lee's certificate is still valid (revocation check).<br>6. (5c) The CA answers regarding the certificate's status. Cheng can then trust Lee's public key if the certificate is valid.|PKI, Certificate Issuance, Certificate Validation, Process|Fig 5-18, 5-47
What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?|- Authentication is proof of identity (who you are).<br>- Authorization is the assignment of permissions (what you are allowed to do) to individuals or roles.|Authentication, Authorization, Permissions|5-48
Does being authenticated mean you can do everything?|No, just because you are authenticated does not mean that you should be able to do everything.|Authorization, Access Rights|5-48
What is the "Principle of Least Permissions"?|Initially give people only the permissions they absolutely need to do their job. If an assignment is too narrow, additional permissions can be given later.|Authorization, Least Privilege, Security Principle|5-49
What is an advantage of following the Principle of Least Permissions, even if it inconveniences users?|Errors in permission assignment tend not to create security problems (it "fails safely"). This may frustrate users somewhat if they need more access later.|Authorization, Least Privilege, Fail Safe|5-49
Why is giving extensive or full permissions initially a bad practice?|- The user will almost always have more permissions than needed.<br>- If permissions are later taken away, errors in this process could still leave excessive permissions (does not "fail safely").<br>- This could allow users to take actions contrary to security policy.|Authorization, Over-Privileging, Security Risks|5-50
How does Auditing relate to Authentication and Authorization?|- Authentication: Who a person is.<br>- Authorization: What a person may do with a resource.<br>- Auditing: What the person actually did.|Auditing, Authentication, Authorization, Accountability|5-51
What is logging in the context of auditing?|Recording events, such as logins, failed login attempts, file deletions, etc., on a server. These events are stored in a log file.|Auditing, Logging, Log Files, Event Tracking|5-52
Why is regular log reading crucial?|If logs are not read regularly, the log becomes a useless write-only memory, and important security incidents might be missed.|Auditing, Log Analysis, Security Monitoring|5-53
What practices help ensure log files are useful?|- Regular log reading.<br>- Periodic external audits of log file entries and reading practices.<br>- Automatic alerts for strong threats.|Auditing, Log Management, Best Practices|5-53
What is the role of a RADIUS Central Authentication Server as shown in Figure 5-21?|1. A supplicant sends credentials (e.g., password) to an Authenticator (e.g., a network access server).<br>2. The Authenticator forwards these credentials to the RADIUS server to check if they are OK.<br>3. The RADIUS server verifies the credentials and sends back an OK (or rejection) and any authorizations.<br>4. If OK, the Authenticator grants access (e.g., "Welcome") to the supplicant.|RADIUS, Central Authentication, Network Access|Fig 5-21, 5-54
What is Kerberos?|Kerberos is a network authentication protocol designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography.|Kerberos, Authentication Protocol|5-55, 5-56
Describe the Kerberos Initial Login process (Figure 5-22).|1. The supplicant (user on a client PC) sends their name and authentication credentials (derived from their password) to the Kerberos server (Key Distribution Center - KDC).<br>2. If authentication is successful, the KDC issues a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) back to the supplicant. This TGT is proof of identity.|Kerberos, Initial Login, TGT, KDC|Fig 5-22, 5-55
Describe the Kerberos Ticket Granting Service process (Figure 5-23) for accessing a Verifier (server).|1. The Supplicant (client PC) sends its TGT and the name of the Verifier (service it wants to access) to the Kerberos server (KDC).<br>2. The KDC verifies the TGT and issues a symmetric session key (A-V SSK) and a service ticket (S-TKT) for that specific Verifier. These are sent back to the Supplicant.<br>3. The Supplicant sends the service ticket (S-TKT, which contains the A-V SSK encrypted with the Verifier's key) to the Verifier.<br>4. The Verifier decrypts the service ticket to get the symmetric session key (A-V SSK).<br>5. The Supplicant and Verifier can now communicate securely using the shared A-V SSK.|Kerberos, Ticket Granting, Service Ticket, Session Key|Fig 5-23, 5-56

What does Figure 5-24 illustrate about Directory Server Organization?|It shows a directory server with a hierarchical object structure (e.g., University -> Faculty -> Brown). It also shows other servers (Kerberos, Radius) potentially interacting with it, for example, to get Brown's digital certificate via an LDAP request. O=Organization, OU=Organizational Unit, CN=Common Name.|Directory Servers, Hierarchy, LDAP, Example|Fig 5-24, 5-58
What is LDAP?|Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. It is used to retrieve data from a directory server.|LDAP, Directory Access, Protocol|5-59
How can a directory server be used to centralize authentication information (Figure 5-25)?|A central directory server can store identity data. Multiple authentication servers (A and B) can query this directory server for information needed to authenticate supplicants (Y, Z, X) connecting through various authenticators (Q, P, R).|Directory Servers, Centralized Authentication, Identity Data|Fig 5-25, 5-60

What is a "tree of domains" in Active Directory?|Multiple domains can be organized into a hierarchical tree structure.|Active Directory, Domain Tree|Fig 5-26, 5-62
What is a "forest of trees" in Active Directory?|Multiple domain trees can form a forest. (Not explicitly shown in the diagram but mentioned).|Active Directory, Domain Forest|Fig 5-26, 5-62
How does replication work between domain controllers in Active Directory?|- Domain controllers within the same domain perform total replication of that domain's data.<br>- Domain controllers in parent and child domains (in a tree) do partial replication.|Active Directory, Replication, Data Synchronization|Fig 5-26, 5-62
What is Identity Management (IdM)?|The centralized policy-based management of all information required for access to corporate systems by a person, machine, program, or other resource.|Identity Management, IdM, Centralized Control|5-63
What is an "identity" in the context of IdM?|The set of attributes about a person or nonhuman resource that must be revealed in a particular context.|Identity Management, Attributes, Context|5-64
What is the "Principle of minimum identity data"?|Only reveal the information (attributes) necessary in a particular context.|Identity Management, Minimum Disclosure, Privacy|5-64
What are key aspects of Identity Lifecycle Management?|- Initial credential checking<br>- Defining identities (pieces of information to be divulged)<br>- Managing trust relationships<br>- Provisioning, reprovisioning if changes, and deprovisioning<br>- Implementing controlled decentralization<br>- Providing self-service functions (e.g., password reset)|Identity Management, Lifecycle, Processes|5-65
What does "trust" mean in the context of directory servers and identity management?|It means that one directory server will accept information from another.|Identity Management, Trust, Directory Servers|5-66
What are different types of trust relationships in identity management?|- Mutual (Bidirectional): Both servers trust each other.<br>- One-way: One server trusts another, but the trust is not reciprocated.<br>- Transitive: If Server X trusts Y, and Y trusts Z, then X automatically trusts Z.<br>- Intransitive: If Server X trusts Y, and Y trusts Z, X does not automatically trust Z.|Identity Management, Trust Types, Relationships|5-66
What is the role of a Metadirectory server as shown in Figure 5-28?|A Metadirectory server synchronizes multiple directory servers. For example, if a user changes their password in one system (e.g., AD server X), the metadirectory server propagates this change to other connected directory servers (e.g., Sun ONE directory server, Kerberos authentication server), allowing the user (Supplicant X) to log in with the new password across different systems.|Metadirectory, Synchronization, Identity Management|Fig 5-28, 5-67
What is Federated Identity Management?|A system where business partners do not access each other's identity databases directly. Instead, they send assertions (statements) about a person, and the receiver trusts these assertions.|Federated IdM, Trust, Assertions, Interoperability|Fig 5-29, 5-68
What is SAML (Security Association Markup Language)?|An XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, particularly in federated identity management. SAML 2.0 Assertion uses XML for platform independence.|SAML, Federated IdM, XML, Standard|Fig 5-29, 5-68, 5-69
What kind of information can a SAML Assertion contain?|- Authentication: e.g., User AX is authenticated.<br>- Authorizations: e.g., User AX can Buy, Check Status.<br>- Attributes: e.g., User AX's role is Buyer, Purchase Limit is X.|SAML, Assertions, Authentication, Authorization, Attributes|Fig 5-29, 5-68, 5-69
What are some benefits of Identity Management?|- Reduction in redundant work to manage identity information.<br>- Consistency in information.<br>- Rapid changes (propagation of updates).<br>- Central auditing.<br>- Single Sign-On (SSO) or at least reduced sign-on.<br>- Increasingly required to meet compliance requirements.|Identity Management, Benefits, SSO, Compliance|5-70
