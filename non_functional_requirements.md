# Project XXX: Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

## Introduction / Overview 🎯

*   **What is this document about?** This document outlines the key Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for Project XXX, the intelligent medical scribe assistant.
*   **What purpose does it serve?** It defines the quality attributes, operational characteristics, and constraints of the system, guiding design and development decisions.
*   **Who is the intended audience?** The project team, architects, developers, and testers.

## Section 1: Performance 🚀

*   **P1. Transcription & Note Generation Latency (MVP):**
    *   **Requirement:** For a pre-recorded audio file of typical consultation length (e.g., 5-15 minutes), the system should generate the full SOAP note draft within an acceptable timeframe for clinician review. Target: < 5 minutes from audio upload completion to note display.
    *   **Rationale:** Minimize clinician waiting time to ensure workflow efficiency.
*   **P2. UI Responsiveness (MVP):**
    *   **Requirement:** The web interface for audio upload, transcript viewing, and note display should be responsive, with page loads and interactions completing within 2-3 seconds.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensure a smooth and non-frustrating user experience.

## Section 2: Accuracy & Reliability 🎯

*   **AR1. Transcription Accuracy:**
    *   **Requirement:** The ASR module (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text medical\_conversation model) should achieve a high Word Error Rate (WER) benchmark suitable for medical conversations. (Specific WER target to be defined based on model capabilities and pilot testing).
    *   **Rationale:** Accurate transcription is fundamental for generating correct clinical notes.
*   **AR2. Clinical Information Extraction Accuracy:**
    *   **Requirement:** The NLP/LLM module (Gemini API with prompt engineering) must accurately identify and extract relevant subjective, objective, assessment, and plan details from the transcript. It must also correctly identify when information for a section is not present.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures the generated SOAP notes are clinically valid and useful.
*   **AR3. System Availability (Post-MVP):**
    *   **Requirement:** Target 99.9% uptime for production services. (MVP will be best-effort).
    *   **Rationale:** Ensure clinicians can rely on the service during their working hours.
*   **AR4. Error Handling:**
    *   **Requirement:** The system must gracefully handle errors (e.g., audio format issues, API failures from Google services, network problems) and provide informative feedback to the user.
    *   **Rationale:** Maintain system stability and user trust.

## Section 3: Usability 🧑‍💻

*   **U1. Ease of Use (MVP):**
    *   **Requirement:** The user interface should be intuitive, requiring minimal training for clinicians to upload audio, view transcripts, and review notes.
    *   **Rationale:** Facilitate rapid adoption and minimize disruption to clinical workflows.
*   **U2. Clarity of Information (MVP):**
    *   **Requirement:** Transcripts and generated SOAP notes must be presented clearly and legibly.
    *   **Rationale:** Allow for efficient review by clinicians.

## Section 4: Security 🔒

*   **S1. Data Protection (PHI/PII):**
    *   **Requirement:** While the MVP handles pre-recorded audio, all data (audio, transcripts, notes) must be handled with considerations for patient privacy and data security. Specific compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, Malaysian PDPA) to be fully addressed in later phases, but foundational security practices must be in place.
    *   **Rationale:** Protect sensitive patient information.
*   **S2. Access Control (MVP):**
    *   **Requirement:** Basic user authentication to access the web application.
    *   **Rationale:** Prevent unauthorized access to the system.
*   **S3. API Key Security:**
    *   **Requirement:** Secure management of API keys for Google Cloud services.
    *   **Rationale:** Protect access to paid cloud resources.

## Section 5: Maintainability & Extensibility 🛠️

*   **M1. Modular Design:**
    *   **Requirement:** The system architecture should be modular (as outlined in the project deck: Input, ASR, NLP/LLM, Output, Frontend) to allow for independent development, testing, and updating of components.
    *   **Rationale:** Facilitate easier maintenance and future enhancements.
*   **M2. Code Quality:**
    *   **Requirement:** Code should be well-documented, follow consistent coding standards, and include unit/integration tests where appropriate.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensure long-term maintainability.
*   **M3. Configuration Management:**
    *   **Requirement:** Key system parameters (e.g., LLM prompt versions, API endpoints) should be configurable.
    *   **Rationale:** Allow for easier updates and adjustments without code changes.
*   **M4. Extensibility for Languages (Future):**
    *   **Requirement:** The architecture should be designed to accommodate future support for multiple languages (Bahasa Melayu, Mandarin, Tamil) without requiring a complete redesign.
    *   **Rationale:** Support the project's growth strategy.
*   **M5. Extensibility for EHR Integration (Future):**
    *   **Requirement:** The output module (JSON SOAP notes) should be designed with future FHIR compatibility and EHR integration in mind.
    *   **Rationale:** Support the project's growth strategy.

## Section 6: Scalability (Post-MVP) 📈

*   **SC1. User Load:**
    *   **Requirement:** The system should be designed to handle a growing number of concurrent users and processing requests as adoption increases (specific targets TBD).
    *   **Rationale:** Ensure the system can support market growth.
*   **SC2. Data Volume:**
    *   **Requirement:** The system should be ableto manage increasing volumes of audio data, transcripts, and notes (specific targets TBD).
    *   **Rationale:** Support long-term data storage and processing needs.

## Section 7: Interoperability (Future) 🔄

*   **I1. EHR Integration (FHIR):**
    *   **Requirement:** Future versions should support integration with EHR systems, prioritizing FHIR standards.
    *   **Rationale:** Enhance value proposition and facilitate adoption in clinical settings.

## Summary / Key Takeaways 💡

The NFRs for Project XXX emphasize accuracy, usability, and security for the MVP, with a clear path towards scalability, maintainability, and interoperability for future growth. These requirements will guide the architectural and technical decisions throughout the project lifecycle.
